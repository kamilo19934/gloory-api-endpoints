Pagination Limitations
The API has the following pagination limitations:



Standard Pagination (page & pageLimit)

Can fetch a maximum of 10,000 records in total
Use page  and pageLimit  parameters


Note: 

The API with Standard Pagination supports retrieving up to 10,000 records in total, with a maximum of 500 records per request. To access all records, use the page and pageLimit parameters to paginate through results. 

For example, page=20 and pageLimit=500 will provide you the last set of result set using pagination API.





Cursor-based Pagination (searchAfter & pageLimit)

Required for accessing more than 10,000 records
Use the searchAfter parameter returned in each response to fetch the next set of results
Do not include the page  parameter when using searchAfter 
This allows for efficient pagination through large result sets

Filters


The Search Contacts API supports a variety of filters that allow users to refine their search results based on specific criteria. Filters can be applied individually or grouped together using logical operators (AND, OR) to create complex search queries each comprising three essential components:

Field: Indicates the attribute or property of contacts by which the filter is applied. For example, contactName refers to the name of the contact.
Operator: Specifies the operation to be performed on the field to filter contacts. Operators define the type of comparison or matching to be executed.
Value: Represents the specific value against which the field is compared using the specified operator. This value varies based on the filter criteria and can be a string, number, or other data type relevant to the field being filtered.

  "filters": [
    {

          "operator": "contains",
          "value": "John"
        },
        {
